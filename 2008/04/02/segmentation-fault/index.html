    <h1 class="title">Segmentation Fault</h1>
    <div class="entry"><p>Last week I made the decision to begin the conversion from MySQL to PostgreSQL. Well, more of a benchmark conversion, but none the less. So we begin the installation..</p>

<p>I installed PostgreSQL server, version 8.2, painlessly both locally and on our staging server. I then installed psycopg2 via Python setuptools. Nice, quick and easy, right? <strong>Segmentation Fault</strong> when I try to sync up the database. So I figure maybe setuptools is outdated, and I removed psycopg2 and grabbed it with Darwin Ports. &#8220;Warning: [&#8230;]&#8221; everytime its initialized. I finally managed to get it working by downloading the source and compiling it. About an hour later, the only thing left to do is import the data&#8230;</p>

<p>First I needed to sync the database, <code>manage.py syncdb</code>. Yep, Django makes it quick and easy. Things worked fine, no problems yet.  I began importing the www.ibegin.com database (12 million business listings, among other meta data). About 10% through California (which is massive) I get &#8220;Cannot Adapt&#8221;. First thing that comes through my head is &#8220;What the fuck kind of error message is that?&#8221;. I come from a strictly MySQL background, and I stand behind it to this day. After a little bit of searching, and pestering #postgresql on freenode, I learned that <em>somehow</em> the primary key sequence had corrupted itself.</p>

<p>Correcting the sequence was fairly easy. You select the max value currently, and then do <code>setval()</code> or <code>nextval()</code> respectively on the sequence to fix it. I had no idea why this had occurred however.  I get done about 70% of the way through California, and notice my importer is slowing down. Oh, that&#8217;s right, my version of Django is still horrendously slow because it&#8217;s missing <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/17">#17</a>.</p>

<p>I quickly optimize my script to store everything in memory, and turn off <code>settings.DEBUG</code> because it wastes too damn much memory. I then continue the import from where it left off, and I notice that every so often it hangs. I check my indexes, and my select queries, and they&#8217;re all blazing fast. After a bit more pestering of the #postgresql people, I learned that PGSQL <strong>sucks hardcore</strong> on count queries. Now I didn&#8217;t plan to use them like I was in the importer, but that&#8217;s still a pretty big setback. So, the 1,000,000 extra meta rows that would exist, will have to wait until the import is fully finished.</p>

<p>I get done with California, and move on to Florida, another fairly large state. I screen it and go to bed. I wake up to <strong>Cannot Adapt</strong> Again, &#8220;What the fuck!?&#8221;. This was getting very tiresome, and still is. I&#8217;m still only about 50% done with the import and I&#8217;ve had this come up at least a half dozen times already.</p>

<p>All in all, PostgreSQL is neat. Transactions are great. Row-locking is great. MySQL&#8217;s InnoDB isn&#8217;t. It has a GIS framework. It causes a lot of headaches. Weighing the pros vs the cons, we&#8217;re going to stick with it. We&#8217;ll be deploying the new iBegin.com page (powered by Django) running a PostgreSQl 8.3 database, which will be pretty massive, to which I&#8217;m hoping that I don&#8217;t have to patch Django for ticket #17 to handle it.</p></div>
