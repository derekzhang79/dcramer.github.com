                <content type="html">We&amp;#8217;ve been migrating a lot of data to various places lately at DISQUS. These generally have been things like running
consistancy checks on our PostgreSQL shards, or creating a new system which requires a certain form of denormalized data. It

                <content type="html">I frequently get asked how Disqus deals with schema changes. It&amp;#8217;s a fair question, since we operate a fairly large amount of servers, but I also tend to think the answer is somewhat obvious. So let&amp;#8217;s start with the problem of schema changes at scale (in PostgreSQL).
