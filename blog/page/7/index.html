    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/28/django-scaling-numbers-for-ibegin">Django Scaling Numbers for iBegin</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>So we&#8217;ve been pushing live some changes the last few days over at <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/">iBegin</a>. The biggest one is our brand new Django-powered website. The reason I bring this up, is to show all the haters out there, that Django really can scale well if you&#8217;ve designed your architecture properly from the get-go.</p>

<p>We haven&#8217;t been able to peak yet, as we&#8217;re still doing some configuration changes and changes to the website itself, but so far the numbers are VERY impressive. The server is shared between all of our websites, which are both PHP and Python (Django) powered. It also hosts the memcached instance, and the static files. In fact, the only thing which is not hosted on the server, is the database.</p>

<p>Anyways, here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been able to achieve off some initial siege tests. Keep in mind, this is limited to a single (somewhat randomly chosen) URL, and it varies a little bit depending on which page you&#8217;re hitting (file sizes, cache expirations, etc.). The average we&#8217;re seeing right now is around 200 req/s consistently across the website with siege tests, and our top numbers are around 500 req/s.</p>

<pre><br>ifting the server siege...      done.<br>Transactions:               23305 hits<br>Availability:              100.00 %<br>Elapsed time:               43.32 secs<br>Data transferred:          434.98 MB<br>Response time:                0.05 secs<br>Transaction rate:          537.97 trans/sec<br>Throughput:               10.04 MB/sec<br>Concurrency:               26.68<br>Successful transactions:       23305<br>Failed transactions:               0<br>Longest transaction:            0.69<br>Shortest transaction:            0.00<br></pre>

<p>I will post more results once we&#8217;ve tweaked some of the configuration settings, and I&#8217;ve created a proper URL configuration for siege to target.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/25/quick-profiling-your-django-website-with-debug_toolbar">Quick Profiling Your Django Website With `debug_toolbar`</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p><a href="http://www.pastethat.com/GiPZ1" style="float:right;background:none;padding:5px;"><img src="http://www.pastethat.com/GiPZ1.jpg"/></a>One of the projects that I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time with is the <a href="http://github.com/dcramer/django-debug-toolbar/tree">django-debug-toolbar</a>. It was started off by Rob Hudson, and since has had huge amounts of support. While my fork is quite a ways off of Rob&#8217;s, they&#8217;re both quite useful in their own right. To clear up one very annoying detail: This project is in no way intended to replace profiling tools or complex debugging tools like <em>pdb</em>. It&#8217;s designed to give you quick access to general information to help debug or rough profile your web application.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pastethat.com/MgVcm" style="float:left;background:none;padding:5px;"><img src="http://www.pastethat.com/MgVcm.jpg"/></a>I&#8217;ve been focusing on some of the hardcore features in panels, such as my SQL panel. MySQL users will find this especially useful, as not only do you get EXPLAIN support (provided for all backends which support it via <code>EXPLAIN [statement]</code>) but you also can get a printout of all of the available indexes and their columns. It makes figuring out what&#8217;s going on with your database a lot quicker.</p>

<p>I have also added full tracebacks for both database queries, and cache calls. Again, see the example, but it is another very helpful feature which can assist you in finding where stuff is happening within your codebase.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pastethat.com/ZsReC" style="float:right;background:none;padding:5px;"><img src="http://www.pastethat.com/ZsReC.jpg"/></a>Among the many changes that have been getting thrown into my [somewhat unstable] fork, is a great design revamp by a character who goes by <em>mape</em>. It gives it a much more django-esque feel, and even has a lot of fancy &#8220;web 2.0&#8221; (javascript) actions hooked in, such as inline filtering and sorting of tables.</p>

<p>To try out the project, it&#8217;s just a few simple actions to get it up and running:</p>

<ol><br><li><code>git clone git://github.com/dcramer/django-debug-toolbar.git</code></li><br><li>Add <code>django-debug-toolbar/</code> to your <code>PYTHONPATH</code>.</li><br><li>Add <code>debug_toolbar</code> to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>.</code><br><li>Add <code>'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware'</code> to your middleware. It should go after your Session, Auth, and GZip middleware, but can be placed before most others.</li><br><li>Login via your superuser, or use the <code>INTERNAL_IPS</code> setting to allow your user to access it. Currently <code>DEBUG</code> must also be set to true.</li><br></ol>

<p>I very much urge anyone who&#8217;s interested in the project to give feedback, as well as contribute if they so desire. There&#8217;s still a lot this project can achieve, and it most certainly can be a benefit in most web applications.</p>

<p>Just a note, if you&#8217;re using my branch, the template panel (as of writing) is non functional as I like to source everything, and it&#8217;s being revamped for Django+Jinja.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/22/apple-hardware-the-downside-to-using-a-mac">Apple Hardware &#8211; the Downside to Using a Mac</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Last night, in an attempt to update my PSP, I decided to switch off MAC address filtering on our router (running dd-wrt) and just use a password. I know a little about how the security works, as I was playing around with KisMAC for a while. I&#8217;m aware that WEP is completely worthless in regards to security, and also was aware that WPA is pretty much broken via brute force. So, I went with WPA (WPA2 Personal to be exact). Yay, things are fine and dandy.</p>

<p>So I wake up today, start mucking around with our diff importer for iBegin, and all of a sudden <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/Dle38">this</a> pops up in my face. &#8220;The wireless network appears to have been compromised and will be disabled for a minute.&#8221;. Ok?</p>

<p>I figure maybe it was a fluke, and then all of a sudden my Macbook shuts off (not the first time, random). There goes an hours work. This could be from overheating (though my limited knowledges makes me beliee otherwise), or it&#8217;s just another random issue that I get to deal with. I brought it back up, finished everything I was doing, and all of the issues were gone.</p>

<p>Oh, wait, here we are four hours later, and I was just disconnected from Wifi again with the same error as last time. Now we are here, ranting, about how I wish I could run Mac OS on my own hardware. Apple does a great job with intuitive and slick laptop designs. They do a great job with the UI of their software (I love Mac OS, no regrets). They, however, have repeatedly poor taste in how hardware should work over the years.</p>

<p>If anyone is familiar with either of these issues, and has a solution, let me know :)</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>The author of Jinja, an alternative solution to Django templates, made a <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/cogitations/2008/09/16/why-jinja-is-not-django-and-why-django-should-have-a-look-at-it/">great post</a> about what is wrong with the Django template engine. It&#8217;s a great read if you have any doubts that the philosophy behind Django&#8217;s template engine makes sense.</p>

<p>The truest quote of them all:</p>

<blockquote><br>I like the custom tag system in Django, and I wouln’t want to see it go away if the template engine is improved. But for example “ifnotequal foo bar” “endifnotequal” is no way better than “if foo != bar” “endif”.<br></blockquote>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/11/dealing-with-automated-form-submission-spam">Dealing With Automated Form Submission (Spam)</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Recently I&#8217;ve been incorporating alternative techniques to Captcha to prevent automated form submission on websites, which is typically spam, or something else you don&#8217;t want happening. I added our routines to the new iBegin&#8217;s submission system today, and thought that I&#8217;d share with the world what we&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;m also curious as to what everyone else does to solve these problems, without burdening the user.</p>

<p>On Curse we implemented a middleware, which on any POST request, would confirm that a user had filled in a Captcha box within the last N hours, or had verified themselves as a human being in some other fashion (a text message was our method).</p>

<p>Now in iBegin, and my websites, we use two different methods to prevent spam. One is the <em>honeypot</em> method, which insert a text field with no value. This field is hidden with CSS, and if a value is passed on submission we assume that it&#8217;s a bot or something else trying to submit the form.</p>

<p>The second method, requires the user have JavaScript enabled, but is very similar. We insert another text field, and set the value to &#8216;hello&#8217;. This field is also hidden with CSS, and on submission, we verify the value is still &#8216;hello&#8217;.</p>

<p>If either of this fail, the form will throw a validation error, and of course log the attempt. So far, in all of my use-cases, it has worked very well, and the only &#8220;spam&#8221; I&#8217;ve seen are real users doing it themselves.</p>

<p>So for a more technical look, here&#8217;s a sample of the code from our submission page for business listings:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;display:none;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>These fields are present to prevent automated submission systems. If you see it, please do not fill in a value.
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">varname</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;nospam1&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;&lt;inp&#39;</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="s1">&#39;ut name=&quot;&#39;</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nx">varname</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="s1">&#39;&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;nospam2&quot;</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

And our Django form validation:
<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/09/djangocon-2008-is-over">DjangoCon 2008 Is Over</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Just got back home this evening from DjangoCon. It was really a lot of fun. It&#8217;s always great to be able to put a face to a name, or a 100 faces to names, in this case. I met a lot of really cool people, and some of the presentations were fantastic (especially Cal Henderson&#8217;s).</p>

<p>My presentation went fairly good. I was pretty nervous so I went to my slides way too fast and didn&#8217;t go into the details like I had planned out. I will know next time to make more slides, and to have more notes on what I want to talk about. For anyone who is interested, you can view the slides on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/zeeg/django-con-high-performance-django-presentation/1?from=email&type=comment_onslide&subtype=slideshow">SlideShare</a>.</p>

<p>After hearing a lot of the opinions from people, I think the core Django team is going to take into serious consideration some of the feature requests I&#8217;ve wanted for a while (mostly database related). At least a good 5-10% of the speakers brought up singletons (ticket #17), and several others brought up denormalization and database clustering. I was really glad to see I wasn&#8217;t as crazy as I had thought, and the only person who really needed these features.</p>

<p>A big thanks to everyone who made DjangoCon &#8216;08 possible, hope to be able to go to the next one as well :)</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/07/django-debug-toolbar">Django Debug Toolbar</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>After the presentation yesterday evening, and Cal Anderson showing Pownce&#8217;s debug toolbar for a moment, it seemed like a great idea to create a pluggable out of it. It turned out I wasn&#8217;t the only one with this idea.</p>

<p>I ended up creating a few &#8220;panels&#8221; inside of an overlay toolbar, which showed things like SQL queries, profile output, and cache hits/misses. At the same time, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/robhudson">Rob Hudson</a> had created a pluggable framework for handling these &#8220;panels&#8221;. After somehow running into each other in the lounge at the hotel, we successfully managed to add my panels to the <a href="http://github.com/dcramer/django-debug-toolbar/tree/master">django-debug-toolbar project</a>.</p>

<p>The project is pretty neat. It&#8217;s quite simple, and allows you to have access to some very nice debug/profiling information as long as you are listed in INTERNAL_IPS. It&#8217;s also extendable via panel system, which Rob created.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure when an &#8220;official&#8221; release will be made, but there&#8217;s still a few things planned, both by myself, and by Rob, which will make this a killer app to use.</p>

<p>For now, here&#8217;s some screens&#8230;</p>

<p>(We haven&#8217;t implemented a profile module solution completely yet into the panel system)</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/08/25/wordpress-lifestream-updates">WordPress LifeStream Plugin Updates</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>This weekend I took the opportunity to implement a bunch of changes, and fixes, into the wp-lifestream plugin which I created. It got a quick overhaul on the extensibility end, allowing you to do much more with complex feeds. To demonstrate the power, I went ahead and built the much-requested Pandora feed plugin.</p>

<p>The plugin itself, pulls from three different feeds, and displays different labels based on which feed the data comes from. The new feed format allows you to store a key, which specifies the a sort-of sub-feed within the feed. The changes also allow you to make the labels on all feeds dynamic, by overriding two new functions: <code>get_label_single()</code> and <code>get_label_plural()</code>.</p>

<p>I also went ahead and moved the LifeStream administration into its own tab, instead of trying to integrate my CSS into WordPress. This allows it much better integration with custom administration themes.</p>

<p>You will find that the links to feed sites are now replaced with links to your profiles on those sites (on most feeds). This will make it easier for your visitors to interact with you on the many social networks out there which exist.</p>

<p>And finally among the changes, are more internal changes geared towards hackers who want to customize the output of their feed. The function <code>lifestream_get_events()</code> was added, which accepts the same parameters as the default <code>lifestream()</code> function, but instead returns an array of Event instances. This allows you to do anything from putting your lifestream in a custom sidebar template, to sticking your recent tweets on the homepage.</p>

<p>Among the TODO, when I get more time, is support for WPMU, and as always, more feeds.</p>

<p>If you think there&#8217;s something that would make a good addition, feel free to let me know. Either drop me an <a href="mailto:dcramer@gmail.com">email</a> or post a comment on the <a href="/my-projects/lifestream">project page</a>.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>One of the tasks that seems to come up every single project we do, is changing the auth backend to accept email addresses. Since it&#8217;s such a common task for us, it can&#8217;t be that rare to want this functionality. So, here&#8217;s a quick and simply backend which accomplishes this, using the built-in <em>django.contrib.auth</em> module.</p>
