    <div class="entry">
        <p>In preparation for a possible change in Curse&#8217;s caching strategy, I took the time today to do some benchmarks of memcached. The benchmarks were taken using the standard python-memcached library as well as 3rd party library for PHP (I couldn&#8217;t get Leopard working with the PECL package). It turns out, Python is actually <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/?G9lDG">fairly fast</a> in its memcached client.</p>

<p>The idea behind our new strategy, is something that I&#8217;ve seen talked about quite a bit (once I started researching), row-level cache objects.</p>

<p>Typically people store a group of objects in a cache, as we are still. You end up with many different groups of many objects. In most cases, you&#8217;re going to have overlapping, where you have the same objects in many different caches.</p>

<p>The major problem comes in when you need to do invalidation. How do you invalidate all caches containing X object? There are several solutions around, none of which are very concrete in how they can solve every problem you can possibly think of.  Many languages such as .NET also employ their own solutions for caching.</p>

<p>Using Django, with memcached, offers an interesting twist to the row-level object caching. The plan would be to design a &#8220;CachedModel&#8221; which would simply say &#8220;all requests to this model need to hit the cache&#8221;. Now that we have a model that is going to cache everything, we need to know how we&#8217;re going to cache it, and more importantly, how we&#8217;re going to (automatically) invalidate it.</p>

<p>Invalidation has been one of the most difficult tasks we&#8217;ve faced in the last year. The original approach was to manually delete keys (yes, not a good idea) that we define in some routine. What the new system would accomplish is automatically updating any cache immediately when an object is changed, or removed.</p>

<p>There are two systems which we must take into consideration:<br><ul><br><li>Lists of objects (such as a list of articles)</li><br><li>Individual objects (a single article)</li><br></ul><br>Handling invalidation on the single object caches is easy, so why not leave at that? The plan is simply, just that. Invalidation will simply be invalidating the single object in the cache.</p>

<p>To solve the issue of lists of objects needing invalidation we transparently handle this by simply caching a list of references (say its a list of 10 cache keys, which you then do a bulk get on). When you update the title of your article, you simply update its object cache, and any cache that references is going to be pulling in that object cache so it is immediately updated as well.</p>

<p>Removing objects is also fairly simply. When we are polling for our list of references, we&#8217;re going to need to see what&#8217;s missing. When we find missing objects, we try to get them (query the database). If they fail, our cache is no longer valid. Easy, ya?</p>

<p>All in all, this would potentially solve all of our current caching needs. It doesn&#8217;t handle every case (such as invalidating a list of new objects when a new one is added), but those could be handled with dependencies or signals.</p>

<p>If you have your own caching stories, or solutions, please share them! I&#8217;d be glad to hear from anyone else who has similar problems, or even larger problems.</p>

        <p>It&#8217;s been a hectic month getting everything done, but we&#8217;ve finally managed to push live the new site.Â  You&#8217;ll find a whole slew of changes to the design as well as some minor tweaks to some of the features. Most noticably:<br><ul><br><li>The header now makes sense. No more double takes and confusion in finding what you want.</li><br><li>The portal pages are now modularized and show much more content.</li><br><li>The main page has been revamped greatly. It shows compilations of the best content from all over Curse, including a brand new news feed.</li><br></ul><br>We have also tuned a lot of the site for performance, and fixed numerous bugs, so <a href="http://www.curse.com/">check it out</a>!</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>So today, being the usual day, I needed a pastebin, that wasn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.pastebin.com">slow</a>, or <a href="http://www.pastebin.ca">bogged up</a> with ads and stuff. I hopped on over to <a href="http://www.dpaste.com/">dpaste.com</a> as I usually would, to find that the domain was temporarily expired (it&#8217;s back up now). Being that the site was down for a little bit, and the project was small, I took an hour to write a pastebin (in PHP, I know).</p>

<p>So, here you have it, with enough features to hold you over, and robust enough to be slashdotted: <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/">PasteThat.</a></p>

<p>The featureset:<br><ul><br><li>Pastes are generated with a unique key &#8211; I myself don&#8217;t want random people reading my pastes :)</li><br><li>Pastes never expire &#8211; there&#8217;s really no storage limitation on my system</li><br><li>It uses the Geshi syntax highlighter &#8211; which seems slow, so I&#8217;ll have to optimize it if people actually use the site</li><br><li>It will remember your name and syntax if you let it set a cookie.</li><br><li>It automatically adjusts the size of the textarea based on your browser window&#8217;s size.</li><br><li>You can post follow ups (and with comments as soon as I get home), as well as view followups for a post.</li><br></ul><br>TODO (when I feel like it and am not busy with work)<br><ul><br><li>Add tags to each paste</li><br><li>Add a public boolean for each paste</li><br><li>Allow people to browse public pastes by tags/date/traffic</li><br></ul><br>The simple goal: A robust and simplified pastebin that has many uses.. and I won&#8217;t ever have to worry about not being able to use.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>As many people probably have, I ran across the problem of installing MySQLdb (Python) on Leopard today.</p>

<p>The error:</p>

<pre>In file included from /usr/local/mysql/include/mysql.h:43,<br>from _mysql.c:40:<br>/usr/include/sys/types.h:92: error: duplicate 'unsigned'<br>/usr/include/sys/types.h:92: error: two or more data types<br>in declaration specifiers<br>error: Setup script exited with error: command 'gcc' failed<br>with exit status 1<br></pre>

<p>Luckily, there are people out there who know a lot more than me about these things, and someone had already found <a href="http://sysadmin.adnanwasim.com/2007/10/mysqldb-on-leopard.html">a fix</a>:</p>

<blockquote><br>To get mysqldb working on leopard I <a href="http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?50,175059,179979#msg-179979">found</a> I had to edit _mysql.c and edit out the lines:

<pre><br>#ifndef uint<br>#define uint unsigned int<br>#endif<br></pre>

<p>I also had to edit site.cfg and mark threadsafe to False.</blockquote><br>After doing this, I managed to get MySQLdb to install, great! Not so fast, there was yet another problem:</p>

<pre><br>Referenced from: .../_mysql.so<br>Reason: image not found<br></pre>

<p>The solution:<br><pre><br>sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib/ /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql<br></pre><br></blockquote></p>

        <p>We&#8217;ve put live a new &#8220;events&#8221; section on Curse.com today. Once again, proving how quick Django is, we whipped this up in 2 days. Currently it&#8217;s prepped for the <a href="http://events.curse.com/blizzcon/">Blizzcon</a> event this weekend, which we&#8217;ll be covering. It aggregates data from the rest of the site based on several data keys.</p>

<p>So if you&#8217;ll be attending, head over and click the giant &#8220;I&#8217;m Attending!&#8221; button. This is the first step in our user awards/badges system, in which users will receive a market saying they were attending Blizzcon 2007.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>We finally managed to get the new site pushed out the door last week, and it&#8217;s been one hell of a ride. It&#8217;s a complete overhaul of the old codebase, including a completely new template engine (Jinja), a new internatlization handler (in-house), and quite a few tweaks on the backend.</p>

<p>For the past week we&#8217;ve been struggling with it, as we&#8217;ve hit a bumpy road. Random problems appearing that we haven&#8217;t yet been able to explain (thus, some randomly slow load times). On that note, we&#8217;ll be pushing out a lot more updates, at a lot faster rate.</p>

<p>And worry not Django fans, we&#8217;re going to be contributing more than ever. Brian Harring joined the team recently, his sole purpose, to make Django awesome. He&#8217;s done great work in a few various places that have been enormous amounts of help to us.</p>

<p>We also just recently released a patch to add <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5020">.group_by() support</a>, although not supported by Django officially, it may be useful to some of you. We&#8217;ll also possibly be releasing a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/3b33bfe1e625b4ad">new select_related() optimization</a> if people are interested, again, probably won&#8217;t be adopted in trunk.</p>
