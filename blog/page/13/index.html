    <div class="entry">
        <p>So today, being the usual day, I needed a pastebin, that wasn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.pastebin.com">slow</a>, or <a href="http://www.pastebin.ca">bogged up</a> with ads and stuff. I hopped on over to <a href="http://www.dpaste.com/">dpaste.com</a> as I usually would, to find that the domain was temporarily expired (it&#8217;s back up now). Being that the site was down for a little bit, and the project was small, I took an hour to write a pastebin (in PHP, I know).</p>

<p>So, here you have it, with enough features to hold you over, and robust enough to be slashdotted: <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/">PasteThat.</a></p>

<p>The featureset:<br><ul><br><li>Pastes are generated with a unique key &#8211; I myself don&#8217;t want random people reading my pastes :)</li><br><li>Pastes never expire &#8211; there&#8217;s really no storage limitation on my system</li><br><li>It uses the Geshi syntax highlighter &#8211; which seems slow, so I&#8217;ll have to optimize it if people actually use the site</li><br><li>It will remember your name and syntax if you let it set a cookie.</li><br><li>It automatically adjusts the size of the textarea based on your browser window&#8217;s size.</li><br><li>You can post follow ups (and with comments as soon as I get home), as well as view followups for a post.</li><br></ul><br>TODO (when I feel like it and am not busy with work)<br><ul><br><li>Add tags to each paste</li><br><li>Add a public boolean for each paste</li><br><li>Allow people to browse public pastes by tags/date/traffic</li><br></ul><br>The simple goal: A robust and simplified pastebin that has many uses.. and I won&#8217;t ever have to worry about not being able to use.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>As many people probably have, I ran across the problem of installing MySQLdb (Python) on Leopard today.</p>

<p>The error:</p>

<pre>In file included from /usr/local/mysql/include/mysql.h:43,<br>from _mysql.c:40:<br>/usr/include/sys/types.h:92: error: duplicate 'unsigned'<br>/usr/include/sys/types.h:92: error: two or more data types<br>in declaration specifiers<br>error: Setup script exited with error: command 'gcc' failed<br>with exit status 1<br></pre>

<p>Luckily, there are people out there who know a lot more than me about these things, and someone had already found <a href="http://sysadmin.adnanwasim.com/2007/10/mysqldb-on-leopard.html">a fix</a>:</p>

<blockquote><br>To get mysqldb working on leopard I <a href="http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?50,175059,179979#msg-179979">found</a> I had to edit _mysql.c and edit out the lines:

<pre><br>#ifndef uint<br>#define uint unsigned int<br>#endif<br></pre>

<p>I also had to edit site.cfg and mark threadsafe to False.</blockquote><br>After doing this, I managed to get MySQLdb to install, great! Not so fast, there was yet another problem:</p>

<pre><br>Referenced from: .../_mysql.so<br>Reason: image not found<br></pre>

<p>The solution:<br><pre><br>sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib/ /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql<br></pre><br></blockquote></p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Since we haven&#8217;t had time to finish setting up code.curse.com, I pushed both our wikimarkup app, and the SphinxSearch ORM layer to Google code.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/wikimarkup/">wikimarkup</a> is a Python library (Django isn&#8217;t required) which allows you to format text based on the MediaWiki standards. Several benchmarks we did have shown this to be 2-2.5x faster than Trac&#8217;s wiki formatting.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-sphinx/">django-sphinx</a> is a wrapper for the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> ORM and the <a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com">Sphinx</a> full-text search engine.

        <p>We&#8217;ve put live a new &#8220;events&#8221; section on Curse.com today. Once again, proving how quick Django is, we whipped this up in 2 days. Currently it&#8217;s prepped for the <a href="http://events.curse.com/blizzcon/">Blizzcon</a> event this weekend, which we&#8217;ll be covering. It aggregates data from the rest of the site based on several data keys.</p>

<p>So if you&#8217;ll be attending, head over and click the giant &#8220;I&#8217;m Attending!&#8221; button. This is the first step in our user awards/badges system, in which users will receive a market saying they were attending Blizzcon 2007.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>We finally managed to get the new site pushed out the door last week, and it&#8217;s been one hell of a ride. It&#8217;s a complete overhaul of the old codebase, including a completely new template engine (Jinja), a new internatlization handler (in-house), and quite a few tweaks on the backend.</p>

<p>For the past week we&#8217;ve been struggling with it, as we&#8217;ve hit a bumpy road. Random problems appearing that we haven&#8217;t yet been able to explain (thus, some randomly slow load times). On that note, we&#8217;ll be pushing out a lot more updates, at a lot faster rate.</p>

<p>And worry not Django fans, we&#8217;re going to be contributing more than ever. Brian Harring joined the team recently, his sole purpose, to make Django awesome. He&#8217;s done great work in a few various places that have been enormous amounts of help to us.</p>

<p>We also just recently released a patch to add <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5020">.group_by() support</a>, although not supported by Django officially, it may be useful to some of you. We&#8217;ll also possibly be releasing a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/3b33bfe1e625b4ad">new select_related() optimization</a> if people are interested, again, probably won&#8217;t be adopted in trunk.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/07/02/inline-blocks-the-answer-to-sprites">Inline Blocks &#8211; the Answer to Sprites</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>We&#8217;ve been working a lot on the new design at Curse lately, and one thing we&#8217;ve used heavily are CSS sprites. The only issue we had with these is they have to be a block element (or an inline-block element) in order to display them properly.</p>

<p>My first solution was to simply float them and wrap them in a fixed height container. This worked, but you can&#8217;t use text-align when they are floated. About a week later while I was looking at some cool CSS trick I found a better solution: inline-block wrappers.</p>

<p>&#8220;inline-block&#8220; is a value usable on display, which makes your element act like a block element, but without clearing content around it. The problem arises though, that inline-block does not work in older browsers.</p>

<p>The solution: wrap your block element in a container using inline-block styles. Below is the example and solution.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nc">.inline</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">moz</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">inline</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">block</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">moz</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">inline</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">box</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">inline</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">block</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>span class=&quot;inline&quot;<span class="ni">&amp;gt;&amp;lt;</span>div<span class="ni">&amp;gt;</span>My inline block element<span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>/div<span class="ni">&amp;gt;&amp;lt;</span>/span<span class="ni">&amp;gt;</span>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2007/06/22/wowheadcom-joins-the-ige-parade">Wowhead.com Joins the IGE Parade</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Wowhead.com, a very popular, World of Warcraft site with growth records spiking as high (if not higher) than Curse&#8217;s when it first launched seems to have given up (just like nearly everyone else). I was informed by <a href="http://www.techsoapbox.com/hot-off-the-presses-wowhead-sold-for-over-1-million/">a colleague</a> today that they were purchased by &#8220;Affinity Media&#8221; &#8211; one of IGE&#8217;s many fronts, parent companys, child companies; not that I know, or care, but they are related.</p>

<p>IGE, for those who aren&#8217;t familiar, is one of the largest and most controversial virtual currency providers in online gaming. It has been hated, and used, by massive amounts of players over the last few years.</p>

<p>Over the past year it had been my theory that IGE had been taking a hit, or several, losing enormous amounts of money from their investments, and even more from the gaming publishers and developers cracking down on virtual currency distribution. They wasted way too much cash, on too many sites, and then they did nothing. The site&#8217;s are still fairly large, but sites like Wowhead quickly took the spotlight, as they were created by passionate, driven people.</p>

<p>Now with yet another site in their grasps, one can only assume that they haven&#8217;t wisened up enough to actually learn how to compete in the market. Guess this means we have one less competitor out there now :)</p>
