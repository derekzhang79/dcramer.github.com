  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been annoyed for the last 6 months of using Jinja, as I&#8217;ve been working on numerous different Django projects, and I&#8217;ve had to use <code>django-admin.py</code> vs <code>manage.py</code>. The reason for this is simply, that in my settings.py I had used the <code>djangosupport.configure()</code> routine. I tried moving it to other locations, but they didn&#8217;t seem to work.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;ve refactored the djangosupport module (based on some previous comments by the Pocoo team), and deprecated the magical <code>djangosupport.configure()</code>. You can now properly import the module via <code>jinja.contrib.djangosupport</code> and use all of the same methods that were available via <code>django.contrib.jinja</code>.</p>

<p>The patch also includes <code>handler404</code>, <code>handler500</code>, and <code>direct_to_template</code> methods.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested, here is the <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/v1amU">diff</a> and a matching <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/GQ8Ck">hg bundle</a>. You can also <a href="http://dev.pocoo.org/projects/jinja/ticket/312">view the ticket on Jinja&#8217;s Trac instance</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had recently installed a plugin on my blogged called &#8220;RSS Stream&#8221;. The idea of the plugin is that it can use RSS feeds (and only RSS feeds) from sites to display a mini-feed, or mini-blog, of what you&#8217;re doing. Not being quite content with the plugin, I decided to write my own.</p>

<p>A few hours later, <a href="http://www.davidcramer.net/my-projects/lifestream">wp-lifestream</a> was born. It&#8217;s a very extensible plugin that works with any kind of feed, even if it&#8217;s not XML. The default generic plugin handles both RSS and Atom feeds perfectly, but I had to drop the usage the built-in Magpie and include SimplePIE (since Magpie kept erroring).</p>

<p>By default it includes all of the extensions which were in RSS Stream, as well as a Digg plugin.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I posted another one of my small pluggable apps up on Google code the other day. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-object-view-tracking/">django-object-view-tracking</a> and is most suited for tracking things such as if a user has viewed a thread in a forum.</p>

<p>The API is fairly simple, but may need some improvements based on feedback:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I pushed an update to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-sphinx">django-sphinx</a> repository tonight which includes a sample configuration generation tool.</p>

<p>It allows you to generate a source and index config for a Model based on it&#8217;s field type. For example:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">nibbits.maps.models</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Map</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">djangosphinx</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">djangosphinx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">generate_config_for_model</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Map</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">output</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>This will give you something like:</p>

<pre>
source base
{
    type                = 'mysql'
    strip_html          = 0

    log                 = /var/log/sphinx/searchd.log

    sql_query_pre       =
    sql_query_post      =
    sql_query           = \
    SELECT id, name, game_id, author, description, tileset, map,
    map_filename, visible, checksum, screenshot, date_added \

    sql_query_info      = SELECT * FROM `maps` WHERE `id` = $id

    sql_group_column    = game_id
    sql_group_column    = tileset
    sql_group_column    = visible

    # DateField's and DateTimeField's
    sql_date_column     = date_added
}

index maps
{
    source          = maps
    patg            = maps
    docinfo         = extern
    morphology      = none

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to be giving a talk at DjangoCon, <a href="http://djangocon.org/program">&#8220;High Performance Django&#8221;</a>. I will be discussing what I&#8217;ve done at the past with <a href="http://www.curse.com">Curse.com</a>, what we do presently for <a href="http://www.ibegin.com">iBegin&#8217;s Crazy Datastore</a>, and general tips for scalability and performance in large web applications.</p>

<p>So why am I telling you all of this? I&#8217;m interested in hearing what specifically you&#8217;ve had a hard time dealing with in your own apps. Hurdles that you&#8217;ve had to come over, or that you are still trying to get over. I&#8217;m looking for good topics to fill in the time, and real world examples that are more than just my own that I may be able to dissect.</p>

<p>if you&#8217;ve got anything, throw me an <a href="mailto:dcramer@gmail.com">email</a>, or leave a comment here about it.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my daily problems occurs when I&#8217;m ssh&#8217;d into a remote server and I&#8217;m using nano to edit configuration files or quick scripts to dump information. The problem being, that it screws up differently on different systems.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s start with the problems:</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Using the backspace key doesn&#8217;t remove the trailing character, but rather the leading character, much like the typical delete key does.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> There are two solutions. You can add <code>export TERM=xterm</code> to your .bashrc. Alternatively, you can go into your shell preferences (Command+,), go to Settings, and then select the Advanced tab under your shell. You will see a &#8220;Declare terminal as&#8221; setting, which should also fix the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Using the up/down arrow keys, and possibly a number of other situations where text moves, causes the display to completely fubar and requires restarting the nano session.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use vi I guess&#8230; I&#8217;ve yet to find a solution for this one :(</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I ran across a trick on the net. I use iPython quite a bit, and I love how I can type a partial history command, and then use up/down to cycle through the recently used commands/code lines. I thought it would be pretty cool to have this same technique available in the bash prompt. After a bit of searching, I found some results, so here you go:</p>

<pre># Enable bash history<br>export HISTCONTROL=erasedups<br>export HISTSIZE=10000<br>shopt -s histappend

<p># These set up/down to do the history searching<br>bind '"\e[A"':history-search-backward<br>bind '"\e[B"':history-search-forward<br></pre></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been out of touch for a little over a month now as I&#8217;ve been transitioning from the west to east coast. I decided it would be &#8220;fun&#8221; to head back to my hometown for the summer, and fun it has been.</p>

<p>While looking for a place I had been using tethering on my AT&T network (oh, let me mention I&#8217;m in Nebraska), which is pretty cool. What is even more cool is that they trick you into paying an extra $40 for the access when you already pay $40 for unlimited data usage (want to see my $200 cell bill?). Even better, is that there&#8217;s a &#8220;100 mile deadzone where you are&#8221;, oh wow, that&#8217;s great, and I&#8217;m standing next to the cell tower too! What service I do get, is old-school 2k/s network speeds.</p>

<p>Next up, I finally gave up on Leopard issues, and reverted to Tiger, only to have some interesting issues crop up. I did this all while running on my awesome bluetooth tethering (did I mention AT&T wouldn&#8217;t even officially tell me how to get internet running on my Mac?). Two hours to download MySQL, yes! I&#8217;ve finally gotten back into working mode after about a week of struggles.</p>

<p>Today I committed a few changes to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-sphinx">django-sphinx</a> which hopefully solve any issues that were present with the <code>filter</code> methods. My apologies for not catching these before releasing the newest version.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also been working on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-ratings">django-ratings</a>. The code should be usable, but is still in it&#8217;s early stages. I&#8217;ve been considering, from a suggestion, of removing the choices option, and changing it to a sort-of precision argument. The values would then range from -1.0 to +1.0 and you&#8217;d simply tell it the precision at which votes are tallied.</p>

<p>We also released a new version of <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/labs/share/">iBegin Share</a> sometime last week, which addresses a few problems and adds color themes as well as the ability to embed share links in feeds and other similar content (geared mostly towards the Wordpress plugin).</p>

<p>I also threw up a quick Mercurial bundle with some changes to the Django support in <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/1">Jinja</a></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The question came up today, if there was a database logging solution available for Django. It turned out (to my knowledge) there wasn&#8217;t. So I quickly came up with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-db-log">django-db-log</a>. It&#8217;s a simply middleware which will catch exceptions in Django, and log them to the database, allowing you to easily view them via the admin or your own custom application.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got home from <a href="http://www.kelseygroup.com/drillingdown2008/">DDL</a> friday afternoon, eagerly awaiting to try my copy of GTA4. I had ordered it from EB Games[.com] just prior to leaving on tuesday afternoon. Well, it turned out I had put the wrong billing address, so even though they had charged me (Pending&#8230; ?), they couldn&#8217;t ship the item. Luckily though, GTA wasn&#8217;t like the Wii, and I was able to pick one up at the local GameStop near my house.</p>

<p>So, I start up the PS3, and throw in the game. You get what people are saying is a 7-minute install, which basically copies a bunch of media and files to the Playstation 3 hard drive (3gb worth) to optimize performance. After this, it then proceeds to automatically start a new game (or load the last auto save) for you. It finished the install, no problems whatsoever (although I&#8217;ve seen lots of reports of the game hanging somewhere around here), and then it went to the black loading screen saying &#8220;Starting a new game&#8230;&#8221;. About 10 minutes later I decided there was a problem.</p>

<p>After much searching of forums and Googling of the internet (I wonder when they&#8217;ll put Google into the dictionary?), I managed to find a solution. <strong>Unplug the internet cable</strong>. Voila! It works all of a sudden. Now of course, this is completely useless when I want online play. After getting into the game a little ways, I plugged back in the internet able (and thankfully I saved before this), and the game froze right there. I had to hard boot the PS3 to get past this.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I booted up the game again, and it froze up on the loading mission screen. I read a bit more into the forum posts, and I also found that you might be able to get this to correct itself by going to Quit Game in the PS3&#8217;s dashboard menu. Doing this, by the way, resets your system completely (it crashes the system). Once it had loaded back up again, it managed to get past the loading screen, and I was finally able to get into multiplayer.</p>

<p>Once in multiplayer you join a game&#8217;s lobby (this is after selecting what kind of match you want), and this is about as far as I got. I waited probably about 20 minutes in different rooms waiting for a game to start, and no one ever got one going, so I gave up. I&#8217;m hoping that multiplayer will be fun, but until people figure out how to hit the &#8220;Ready&#8221; button, I think I&#8217;ll stick to completely the singleplayer missions first.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping this post helps everyone else get around their issues with the PS3 version. I haven&#8217;t heard of any problems on the 360 version, so XBox owners may be in luck.</p>

<p>Oh, ya, I&#8217;m <strong>zeeg99</strong> on the PS3 if you want to throw me an add :)</p></div>
