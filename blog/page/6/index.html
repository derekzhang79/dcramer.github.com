    <div class="entry">
        <p>One of the optimizations (if you want to call it that) that can be done for decreased load-time on a web page, is removing excess white space. In many of our pages at <a href="http://www.ibegin.com">iBegin</a> this saved as much as 100kb. While not every site has some of the 300kb pages that we have, it can still add up very quickly.</p>

<p>Django by default provides a <code>&#123;% spaceless %&#125;</code> tag in your templates which will allow you to achieve this effect, but we don&#8217;t use Django&#8217;s template engine (<a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org">Hooray, Jinja!</a>). The tag approach also seemed fairly inappropriate, as we just want to do it across the entire site, no matter what. Instead, we moved it into a middleware, which simply strips all whitespace (using the same method as the built-in tag) from any HTML page.</p>

<p>While this makes some pages unreadable, the time it saves downloading the page for the average user (See Steve Souders&#8217; tips) is well worth the trouble it causes a few people.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/11/22/impressions-of-the-blackberry-storm">Impressions of the BlackBerry Storm</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>I was one of the lucky few around here to get my hands on a BlackBerry Storm on Friday. Let me start by saying, I didn&#8217;t purchase (before or now) an iPhone simply because of AT&T&#8217;s coverage where my parents live. I came into this having never owned a BlackBerry before. I&#8217;ve only owned one other smartphone/pda, and it was the AT&T Tilt (HTC Kaiser). At the best of times, I was unsatisfied with the way the Tilt handled, so the Storm had a lot to prove.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.davidcramer.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/1223442288_blackberrystormhandson-300x202.jpg" alt="" title="1223442288_blackberrystormhandson" width="300" height="202" class="size-medium wp-image-367" /></p>

<p>So first things first, the touch display. It has similar technology to the iPhone (although, from the looks of things the iPhone is a bit more advanced). It has a &#8220;click&#8221; system, much like the touchpad on new Macbooks. You can touch the screen for a hover effect in most places, and push in to get a click. For the most part the screen works very well, and I think the solution is probably more usable than the iPhone&#8217;s simple touch. There are some issues with apps having controls which are too small, but that will probably end up getting worked out in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>All of the applications work just as you&#8217;d expect. They&#8217;re quality business level applications from BlackBerry. From what I understand, it&#8217;s pretty much the same as the other BlackBerry phones, some apps just have different interface controls. It includes all of the normal apps you&#8217;d expect, including your instant messengers, Facebook, Flickr, and even has a Visual Voice Mail app ($1.99/month, lame). Facebook&#8217;s app is nice, but again, you end up with controls that are hard to touch. This same issue arrises in the contact list, and browser as well.</p>

<p>The Storm also has an &#8220;Accelerometer&#8221;. You know, that trendy word that most people have no meaning of (including myself). This is the technology which handles adjusting the display when you rotate or tilt the device. It&#8217;s very cool technology, and works just like you&#8217;d expect on the iPhone. The Storm, on the other hand, does not work as well. I&#8217;ve had numerous issues (I&#8217;ve even updated to the latest released version of the platform) with it not wanting to tilt no matter what you try. I&#8217;ve ended up rebooted the device several times just to fix it (somehow it fixes itself eventually though, and the reboots are fast).</p>

<p>There are also some other issues which, while they are minor, are very annoying at times. One such issue is found in your SMS (and most likely email) controls. There&#8217;s a threaded (sort of) display for messages, and while it&#8217;s decent it&#8217;s not great. Replying to a message works like you&#8217;d expect. Select the message, and hit reply. The issue here however, is that while you&#8217;re typing your message, you sometimes will have trouble finding the &#8220;Send&#8221; button. There are two ways in which you can send: Using &#8220;Send&#8221; in the BlackBerry menu, or hiding the keyboard and hitting the button for send. Hiding the keyboard is obviously a pain, and the menu does not always function correctly. Sometimes it will not show the proper menu as if you were editing a message, but one as if you were simply viewing the threaded discussion still.</p>

<p>Overall I am very pleased with the phone. Most of the small issues are software related, and will likely be fixed very quickly. I was disappointed with the application store not being present at launch (everything I read said it was going to be), as well as the fact that Verizon seemed unprepared for the launch. I think it has a lot of potential, and should make some great consumer friendly competition for Apple. Will I keep it? I guess only time will tell :)</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/11/11/sidebar-widgets-come-to-lifestream">Sidebar Widgets Come to LifeStream</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Tonight I finally took the chance to finish up the sidebar widgets in LifeStream, and I think everyone who&#8217;s been waiting for them will be satisfied. The widget allows you to place one or more, using the dynamic widgets feature which is in WordPress, for any supporting themes. Each widget let&#8217;s you customize the title, the number of items to display, and an optional list of feeds.</p>

<p>The optional list of feeds is where the real power of LifeStream comes in to play. Many people use different plugins to display their Twitter updates, their Delicious updates, and whatever else they may be doing. Before now, it was somewhat difficult for the average WordPress user to do this with LifeStream, but the ability was already there. The sidebar widget will let you replace these single-use plugins, and take it a step further.</p>

<p>[gallery]</p>

<p>Now if you&#8217;re like me, and you use custom HTML for your sidebar, don&#8217;t worry! You can still gain this same functionality from a small piece of code. To do this, let&#8217;s take a look at what the dynamic sidebar widget does in Lifestream:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;lifestream_sidebar_widget(array(</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&#39;number_of_results&#39;=&gt;$options[&#39;amount&#39;],</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&#39;feed_ids&#39;=&gt;$options[&#39;feeds&#39;],</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&#39;event_total_max&#39;=&gt;-1,</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&#39;date_interval&#39;=&gt;-1,</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">));</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
<p>We have a few options here (there are many more), which specify the number of results, an array of feed ids, the &#8220;event_total_max&#8221; (set this to 1 to hide grouped events), and date interval (-1 disables date restrictions). You can simply throw this snippet somewhere in your sidebar, and you&#8217;ll gain the same effect as you would using the dynamic sidebar.</p>

<p>Create a box for just your delicious links, just your tweets, or maybe combine all of your bookmarking services into their own widget. The power is yours :)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I iterate so quickly, that 0.81 is now available with shiny new options.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/11/07/tips-for-scaling-a-web-app">Tips for Scaling a Web App</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>As many of you know, I&#8217;ve been working on things over at <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/">iBegin</a> for the past 6 months. One of the things we did was a complete rewrite of our platform which includes a local business listings directory. While doing this, I had the goal in mind to make it as scalable as possible, and keep the caching as simple as possible. I wanted to give everyone a brief rundown on our philosophy and how we&#8217;ve done that.</p>

<p>The first, and most important thing we&#8217;ve done, is make every page cachable that doesn&#8217;t vary per-user. This is almost every single page on the website, and the only one&#8217;s that aren&#8217;t ready to be cached, are pages like user settings. We also wanted these pages to be cached exactly the same no matter what kind of user was accessing them. For us the best solution in this case, was to draw in common things with JavaScript, such as &#8220;Logged in as David&#8221;, or notifications.</p>

<p>There are two main components in handling this. A JavaScript component, and a backend view. So let&#8217;s show a bit of code, for how we handle this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

As you can see here, on page load, we initiate an AJAX request to /account/jsdata/. This backend then sends us a JSON encoded dictionary of a few various things:

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;is_authenticated&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;username&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;dcramer&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;messages&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[],</span> <span class="s2">&quot;user_id&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

And outputting this data is even easier:

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

Now we have handled making nearly every page on our site cachable, whether it&#8217;s done in memcache, or a reverse proxy.

Our next task is making the database scale. A good 40% of the development time is spent in designing the platform, and most of this relies around the database. We have enormous amounts of denormalization hooks, and very specific indexing. It&#8217;s very common in our database, to store the data from a typical foreign key in the same table which it is referencing.

To give a clear example on where this is beneficial, let&#8217;s take a look at our directory links:

<pre>
http://www.ibegin.com/directory/us/new-york/new-york/acura-of-manhattan-662-11th-ave/
</pre>

Obviously, we have a lot of information in the URL. The typical schema here is that a business has a foreign key to a city, which has a foreign key to a state, which has a foreign key to a country. Ouch! To avoid the relational problems which this schema would create, we store the country, state, and city, all as foreign key references within each actual listing. Even more so, we store the slugs for each one as well.

<p>As you can see, we hook the save method here to ensure that if our city is changed, we update the related fields, country, and state. Please note that <strong>has_changed()</strong> is not part of the Django core.</p>

<p>In this same example, a typical Django application might have been built with singular indexes on country, state, and city, as they are all Foreign Key references and that is the standard in Django. This is one of the first things you should be looking at when optimization your database. In our situation, we could look up a business listing by the country, by the state, or by the city, but it&#8217;s always the country, the country and state, or the country, state, and city, so we can optimize our index here:</p>

<pre>INDEX (`country`, `state`, `city`)</pre>

<p>Since indexes work left to right, this index will handle all three of the above queries, and on our dataset of 12 million records, takes 1 or 2 milliseconds to return a typical dataset.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the tricks we use to optimize things at iBegin, but they are some of the most critical. We also use composite primary keys to handle a semi-shared dataset (we have around 13 million businesses listed), a lot of save triggers such as seen above, and many summary tables. However, we have not modified Django&#8217;s core for any performance optimizations and we are able to do 10-20ms requests without a problem.</p>

    <article class="post">
    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/10/17/how-things-have-changed">How Things Have Changed</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>The last few weeks have had a lot of work related to SEO/SEM both at <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/">iBegin</a> and on random sites of my own, like <a href="http://www.nibbits.com/">Nibbits</a>. On iBegin we&#8217;ve been tweaking our robots handling, meta descriptions, and titles, all to try and get the most out of Google. We&#8217;ve also found we&#8217;ve needed to do much more than that due to some quirks with Google. At Nibbits, it&#8217;s some of the same stuff, but less specific. I use it as more of a benchmark for how things are improving.</p>

<p>So, what have we done?</p>

<p><strong>Change temporary redirects to permanent</strong></p>

<p>One of the first headaches I&#8217;ve had recently, was the discovery that Google doesn&#8217;t really understand, or care, about how your redirects work. It wants you to have unique pages, and not references to those pages. On iBegin, to avoid extra query overhead, we initially had a URL which was /go/slice_ID/key_ID/ for forwarding to a businesses full URL. This was running your standard 302 redirect, which is the common status code for a temporary redirect.</p>

<p>To sum it up, Google complained about these pages being copies of the pages they&#8217;re actually redirecting too (rather than references), so we ended up replacing all indexable redirects with permanent redirects. Anywhere possible, we added more denormalization hooks just to avoid these kind of redirects all together.</p>

<p>Some relevant code:</p>

<strong>Holy shit sitemaps work</strong>

One of the many things introduced over the last couple of years, were the Google sitemaps. I myself had never implemented these on a website until recently simply due to the fact that I never noticed an indexing problem. Let me tell you this has been one of the worst decisions I have ever made. They&#8217;ve been great for keeping iBegin&#8217;s millions of businesses in Google&#8217;s index, as well as immediately adding almost all of Nibbit&#8217;s pages to Google.

For a rough example, Nibbits was up for about 3 months, and had about 3,000 pages in Google. I added sitemaps to it and within a week it jumped to 40,000 pages and growing.

Django providing a nice contrib application for working with sitemaps, but it&#8217;s not quite good enough for all use-cases, like Yahoo crawling 200 sitemaps all at once that aren&#8217;t pre-generated. We ended up rolling out or own <code>generate_sitemaps</code> management command, which writes them to disk. At the moment we haven&#8217;t implemented any code to add or update changed entries.

Here&#8217;s a rough implementation (a bit old) of how ours was working. As you will see, I attempted to use generators to avoid the very scary amount of memory which was being used to generate these.

<p><strong>Unique &lt;title&gt;&#8217;s</strong></p>

<p>One of the many things Google has been whining about (via webmaster tools) was the fact that some of our pages shared the same titles. I&#8217;m unsure yet how this is really affecting the weighting in Google, but it&#8217;s a good thing to note none the less.</p>

<p><strong>Robots and nofollow</strong></p>

<p>Another one of the many things I had not been doing until earlier this year, was using robots.txt and <code>rel="nofollow"</code> in order to prevent Google from distributing it&#8217;s weight to pages which you don&#8217;t really care about. These could be anything from a contact form, to an entire section of your website. This can really help you achieve maximum efficiency for weighting pages which really matter to you in Google, but should also be used cautiously.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about an interesting concept, and potential project lately. Most blogs have a &#8220;Blogroll&#8221;, or a list of other blogs that are typically friends or colleagues. A lot of these bloggers also subscribe to those blogs with RSS readers, or whatever tool suits them. My concept was to socialize this aspect of the blogging atmosphere.</p>

<p>It would work much like your Facebook friendships. You add a friend (in this case, a website), and are notified when updates happen. It could automatically find RSS feeds on most websites (all the major blogging platforms, which is enough to matter), and would even integrate with my <a href="/my-projects/lifestream">lifestream plugin</a>. It could then generate an RSS feed of what&#8217;s going on with all of your friends, including all of their lifestreamed information, and posts from their blogs, without you having to do anything beyond adding &#8220;Friends&#8221; from your blogroll.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#8217;m posting this here to open it up to any feedback out there. I think it&#8217;s a pretty cool idea, and I&#8217;m curious as to how many others would find it useful.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>For most of my sites, and for iBegin especially, we rely heavily on our database. Today we went through a distro upgrade for the database server, and it occurred to me, that we had no good solution for handling these kinds of situations (auto-magically even). I quickly through up a middleware which takes (MySQL only) database OperationalError&#8217;s and verifies if it&#8217;s an &#8220;Unable to connect error&#8221;.</p>

<p>Since we have other solutions for monitoring our database, we can safely assume that anytime the database throws this error it roughly translates to &#8220;we know the database is down, pretend we did it on purpose&#8221;. When it happens, we just throw up a simple template telling the user we&#8217;re doing some maintenance and we&#8217;ll be back shortly.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/28/django-scaling-numbers-for-ibegin">Django Scaling Numbers for iBegin</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>So we&#8217;ve been pushing live some changes the last few days over at <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/">iBegin</a>. The biggest one is our brand new Django-powered website. The reason I bring this up, is to show all the haters out there, that Django really can scale well if you&#8217;ve designed your architecture properly from the get-go.</p>

<p>We haven&#8217;t been able to peak yet, as we&#8217;re still doing some configuration changes and changes to the website itself, but so far the numbers are VERY impressive. The server is shared between all of our websites, which are both PHP and Python (Django) powered. It also hosts the memcached instance, and the static files. In fact, the only thing which is not hosted on the server, is the database.</p>

<p>Anyways, here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been able to achieve off some initial siege tests. Keep in mind, this is limited to a single (somewhat randomly chosen) URL, and it varies a little bit depending on which page you&#8217;re hitting (file sizes, cache expirations, etc.). The average we&#8217;re seeing right now is around 200 req/s consistently across the website with siege tests, and our top numbers are around 500 req/s.</p>

<pre><br>ifting the server siege...      done.<br>Transactions:               23305 hits<br>Availability:              100.00 %<br>Elapsed time:               43.32 secs<br>Data transferred:          434.98 MB<br>Response time:                0.05 secs<br>Transaction rate:          537.97 trans/sec<br>Throughput:               10.04 MB/sec<br>Concurrency:               26.68<br>Successful transactions:       23305<br>Failed transactions:               0<br>Longest transaction:            0.69<br>Shortest transaction:            0.00<br></pre>

<p>I will post more results once we&#8217;ve tweaked some of the configuration settings, and I&#8217;ve created a proper URL configuration for siege to target.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/25/quick-profiling-your-django-website-with-debug_toolbar">Quick Profiling Your Django Website With `debug_toolbar`</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p><a href="http://www.pastethat.com/GiPZ1" style="float:right;background:none;padding:5px;"><img src="http://www.pastethat.com/GiPZ1.jpg"/></a>One of the projects that I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time with is the <a href="http://github.com/dcramer/django-debug-toolbar/tree">django-debug-toolbar</a>. It was started off by Rob Hudson, and since has had huge amounts of support. While my fork is quite a ways off of Rob&#8217;s, they&#8217;re both quite useful in their own right. To clear up one very annoying detail: This project is in no way intended to replace profiling tools or complex debugging tools like <em>pdb</em>. It&#8217;s designed to give you quick access to general information to help debug or rough profile your web application.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pastethat.com/MgVcm" style="float:left;background:none;padding:5px;"><img src="http://www.pastethat.com/MgVcm.jpg"/></a>I&#8217;ve been focusing on some of the hardcore features in panels, such as my SQL panel. MySQL users will find this especially useful, as not only do you get EXPLAIN support (provided for all backends which support it via <code>EXPLAIN [statement]</code>) but you also can get a printout of all of the available indexes and their columns. It makes figuring out what&#8217;s going on with your database a lot quicker.</p>

<p>I have also added full tracebacks for both database queries, and cache calls. Again, see the example, but it is another very helpful feature which can assist you in finding where stuff is happening within your codebase.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pastethat.com/ZsReC" style="float:right;background:none;padding:5px;"><img src="http://www.pastethat.com/ZsReC.jpg"/></a>Among the many changes that have been getting thrown into my [somewhat unstable] fork, is a great design revamp by a character who goes by <em>mape</em>. It gives it a much more django-esque feel, and even has a lot of fancy &#8220;web 2.0&#8221; (javascript) actions hooked in, such as inline filtering and sorting of tables.</p>

<p>To try out the project, it&#8217;s just a few simple actions to get it up and running:</p>

<ol><br><li><code>git clone git://github.com/dcramer/django-debug-toolbar.git</code></li><br><li>Add <code>django-debug-toolbar/</code> to your <code>PYTHONPATH</code>.</li><br><li>Add <code>debug_toolbar</code> to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>.</code><br><li>Add <code>'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware'</code> to your middleware. It should go after your Session, Auth, and GZip middleware, but can be placed before most others.</li><br><li>Login via your superuser, or use the <code>INTERNAL_IPS</code> setting to allow your user to access it. Currently <code>DEBUG</code> must also be set to true.</li><br></ol>

<p>I very much urge anyone who&#8217;s interested in the project to give feedback, as well as contribute if they so desire. There&#8217;s still a lot this project can achieve, and it most certainly can be a benefit in most web applications.</p>

<p>Just a note, if you&#8217;re using my branch, the template panel (as of writing) is non functional as I like to source everything, and it&#8217;s being revamped for Django+Jinja.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/22/apple-hardware-the-downside-to-using-a-mac">Apple Hardware &#8211; the Downside to Using a Mac</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Last night, in an attempt to update my PSP, I decided to switch off MAC address filtering on our router (running dd-wrt) and just use a password. I know a little about how the security works, as I was playing around with KisMAC for a while. I&#8217;m aware that WEP is completely worthless in regards to security, and also was aware that WPA is pretty much broken via brute force. So, I went with WPA (WPA2 Personal to be exact). Yay, things are fine and dandy.</p>

<p>So I wake up today, start mucking around with our diff importer for iBegin, and all of a sudden <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/Dle38">this</a> pops up in my face. &#8220;The wireless network appears to have been compromised and will be disabled for a minute.&#8221;. Ok?</p>

<p>I figure maybe it was a fluke, and then all of a sudden my Macbook shuts off (not the first time, random). There goes an hours work. This could be from overheating (though my limited knowledges makes me beliee otherwise), or it&#8217;s just another random issue that I get to deal with. I brought it back up, finished everything I was doing, and all of the issues were gone.</p>

<p>Oh, wait, here we are four hours later, and I was just disconnected from Wifi again with the same error as last time. Now we are here, ranting, about how I wish I could run Mac OS on my own hardware. Apple does a great job with intuitive and slick laptop designs. They do a great job with the UI of their software (I love Mac OS, no regrets). They, however, have repeatedly poor taste in how hardware should work over the years.</p>

<p>If anyone is familiar with either of these issues, and has a solution, let me know :)</p>
