  <div class="entry-content"><p>So about a year ago, I posted an article about information (supported with evidence I had) saying Diablo 3 was in development, as a Massively Multiplayer Online Game, based upon the idea of Hell invading Heaven. I also told you it would be, originally, debuted at Blizzcon last year, and I was wrong. Supported by more evidence that it was in development, I concluded that it would have to be shown at E3 &#8216;06. Once again, I was wrong.</p>

<p>So why do I think it&#8217;s going to air at Blizzcon 2006? Well, to be quite honest, Blizzard could slap me in the face again and I could be wrong. Just recently opened up in a Wall Street discussion saying they had developed a formula for doing an MMOG in just 3 years. Not only did they divulge some financial information to go along with this, but they also said all Blizzard &#8220;All Blizzard franchises will become MMOGs.&#8221;. Who doubted me? Obviously not IGN, or any of the other major media sites who announced the upcoming release of Diablo 3 based off of my information and findings.</p>

<p>So why Blizzcon &#8216;06, why not E3 next year? Well, the original idea was that Burning Crusade would be out before Blizzcon &#8216;06, so it wouldn&#8217;t make much sense to have another session covering the game, and what else are they going to cover? Sure, they could have Starcraft Ghost Release Candidate 18 for the PS3 or some other bullshit, but let&#8217;s get serious. So let&#8217;s look at some facts:</p>

<p>* Blizzard North closed in 2005, which was the primary location for the Diablo franchise development. The company was merged with as we know now Blizzard Entertainment.<br>* Supposedly&#8211;â€œI am musician in Czech Republic. I play not with one orchestra but with many depending on work. I have recently been to Bratislava in Slovak Republic for recording sessions with local Radio Symphony Orchestra, where we just recorded music for Diablo 3.&#8221; Is this legit? You decide.<br>* Heaven vs Hell. Hell invading Heaven. Normal people don&#8217;t come up with this, and if they did, they would work for a company&#8211;perhaps Blizzard Entertainment? Not only is this a very realistic environment for the Diablo franchise, but the information came from a former Blizzard employee, who was in fact working with the Diablo teams at one point.<br>* And of course, the latest information, from Blizzard saying that all franchises will become MMOGs. Granted, this doesn&#8217;t mean it would happen soon, but with all the evidence supporting Diablo 3, and DMCA&#8217;s I consistently receive for releasing crap, I can see this happening.</p>

<p>There is one thing I did want to address as well. As far as I recall, Blizzard said, upon attending Blizzcon, you would receive a Beta code. If I remember correctly, they also stated the Beta code would not be for the World of Warcraft expansion, but a yet unannounced game release. Two days ago, a Blizzard representative said otherwise, &#8220;..that card is your entrance to play World Of Warcraft expansion before most any one else. I would recommend following the instructions and registering.&#8221; I call bullshit, riot anyone?</p>

<p>Now there is one final determining factor. Will there be a Blizzcon &#8216;06? This of course would play a huge rule on if it&#8217;s announced at the event. If there isn&#8217;t, which is up for debate (and I&#8217;m working on getting confirmation right now), then we may not see it until their next event, as there are no other huge announcements upcoming that I&#8217;m aware of. In my opinion they will save this for their own event, as it makes them a lot more do re me than announcing at E3 would.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I took a little time and moved my wiki off of World of Warcraft Guru since I won&#8217;t be working on the site anymore. I did this for no reason other than the EULA, as Blizzard doesn&#8217;t support it so it makes WG look bad. Doing this I bought a new domain, and buying a new domain lead me to buying more so I give you&#8230; <a href="http://www.hackwow.com/">HackWOW</a>, <a href="http://www.hackvanguard.com/">HackVanguard</a>, and my personal favorite, <a href="http://www.whatisige.com/">What is IGE</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also begun the &#8220;blacklist my sites&#8221; project, for Google. View the source of <a href="http://www.nibbits.com/">Nibbits</a> (scroll to the bottom), and view check the pages it links to. The &#8220;theory&#8221; is that Google counts a backlink as a unique domain (or subdomain), as I&#8217;ve noticed with MMO Files. So in theory 1234.mmofiles.com linking to nibbits.com, counts just as much as 3124.mmofiles.com linking to nibbits.com. Now all they are is an h1 (important!) and an a tag saying &#8220;Pie&#8221; linked a page named Pie, with an H1 labeled Pie, and the word Pie in EM and STRONG on the page, as well as linked to itself. Let&#8217;s see if I rank #1 in Google for Pie in 2 weeks :)</p>

<p>Last but not least, I posted some pictures of the Castle I visited recently on my &#8220;vacation&#8221;. Check them out in my <a href="/photos/">photo gallery</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I finally took the time to rework my tooltips script which is in use on sites like <a href="http://www.wowguru.com/">WoW Guru</a>. I originally created it as an alternative to using overlib and other quite large (bloated?) libraries as I didn&#8217;t need 90% of what they do.</p>

<p>The tooltip library is very simple, as it currently has one option, which let&#8217;s you adjust the horizontal alignment with the source (wherever the tooltip is originating from). To use the library it&#8217;s as simple as including the javascript on your page (most likely in the header) and calling onmouseover=&#8221;showTip(event, &#8216;Text&#8217;);&#8221; on an element.</p>

<p>If this is of use to you, have at it, if you&#8217;d like to see anything changed or added let me know. You can <a href="/wp-content/tooltips.js">download the javascript tooltips source here</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just some notes, so I can hand these out to people:</p>

<p><strong>Every page should have an h1</strong><br>The H1 should specifically tell what that page is. It should not be filled w/ keywords, keep it compact and simple. If your page has news about a game, the h1 should be &#8220;Name of Game News&#8221;. Ok?</p>

<p><strong>The title should be very similar to the h1</strong><br>In most cases, your title can match your h1. Although you may want additional keywords and the added ability to brand the site name. A good structure is H1 Name - Category/Section Name - Site Name</p>

<p>Although for your Index, this is the exception. Your main page (www.blah.com) is a good area to describe what your site is about in the title. Include many keywords but keep it less than 255 characters. &#8220;My Site - Game News, Game Forums, Game Porn&#8221; you get the jist.</p>

<p><strong>Now we have h1 we need h2</strong><br>In my experiences I&#8217;ve followed all of these rules, and I&#8217;ve never used anything to much extend beyond h1 and h2. My rules for h2 are use it for navigation (section) headers, and article titles.</p>

<p>In your nav you may have a section called forums,and list links under it. Forums would be in h2, the links of course should be in a standard list<br>If you have news on your page, make each news title an h2 (I&#8217;ve also seen these pushed to h3 but I believe they have a lot of weight and sticking w/ my routine, I&#8217;ve used h2).</p>

<p><strong>Keyworded links and titles</strong><br>So you have a webpage, and when you link to stuff you say &#8220;click here&#8221; as the link name. Find a new career path (or keep reading). No one searches for &#8220;click here&#8221; so why would you say the page your linking to is about &#8220;click here&#8221;. Your link&#8217;s name should be about what the page is about, makes sense don&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>There *are* exceptions where you need to link something w/ some retarded text, or an image, etc.. This is where the title attribute comes into use. <a title="World of Warcraft" href="http://mmotheatre.com/~dcramer/mysite">CLICK HERE</a> - This basically changes the name of the link to &#8220;World of Warcraft&#8221; in a search engine&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>Keep your html clean, small, and prefix it with an x for even more luck<br>If you can&#8217;t figure out XHTML transitional, refer to finding a new career path. Overloading your page w/ tables, extra attributes, and well, improper tags hurts you not only in bandwidth costs (xhtml vs html) but it can also hurt your SE ranking. This is where using headers, proper linking, and lists comes into play as well.</p>

<p>Use tags as they were meant to be used. It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re sticking your link in an IMG tag are you? So why would you stick paragraph in div, or your list in a table.</p>

<p><strong>URL Rewriting</strong><br>I dont think this does as much as everyone thinks, but it&#8217;s still a nice touch.<br>Most sites have dynamic content, and pages will look something like /myscript.php?someID=5. I prefer to take this, and say for example myscript shows articles. We can use mod_rewrite (google it) and do /articles/5/this-is-fake-words-blah-blah.html.<br>Try this, can&#8217;t say I never did anything for you:</p>

<p>function safe_name($string)<br>{<br>if (!trim($string))<br>return false;<br>$string = preg_replace(&#8216;/[^a-zA-Z0-9_-s.]/&#8217;, &#8221;, $string);<br>$string = preg_replace(&#8216;/s/&#8217;, &#8216;-&#8216;, $string);<br>$string = strtolower($string); // make the string all lowercase values</p>

<p>return $string;<br>}</p>

<p>Already follow all these rules? Congratulations! You are one of the few people who seem to understand this not so complicated concept!<br>Anyways, agree or not, my methods are proven effective, check out <a href="http://www.nibbits.com/">Nibbits</a> for my latest example of finely tuned SE content as well as proof on <a href="http://www.wowguru.com/">World of Warcraft Guru</a>.<br><ul /></p></div>
