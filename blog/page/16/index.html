        <p>To be honest, I&#8217;m not a big football (soccer) fan, but the World Cup is always exciting. This year, I think it may have been even more so. With 10 minutes left in the game, the French team member Zinedine Zidane, decided he had enough. Why? Who knows, but he sure made sure an Italian player, <span class="txt3Bold">Materazzi</span><span class="txt4Bold">, by smashing his head into the Italian player&#8217;s chest.</span></p>

<p>To see it in action, check out my latest site, <a href="http://www.ggzidane.com/">Good Game Zidane</a>. The site was live 10 minutes after the event, gotta love GoDaddy and my servers :)<br><span class="txt4Bold" /></p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2006/06/13/ill-be-seeing-you-at-blizzcon-06-my-precious-diablo-3">I Spy Diablo 3</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>So about a year ago, I posted an article about information (supported with evidence I had) saying Diablo 3 was in development, as a Massively Multiplayer Online Game, based upon the idea of Hell invading Heaven. I also told you it would be, originally, debuted at Blizzcon last year, and I was wrong. Supported by more evidence that it was in development, I concluded that it would have to be shown at E3 &#8216;06. Once again, I was wrong.</p>

<p>So why do I think it&#8217;s going to air at Blizzcon 2006? Well, to be quite honest, Blizzard could slap me in the face again and I could be wrong. Just recently opened up in a Wall Street discussion saying they had developed a formula for doing an MMOG in just 3 years. Not only did they divulge some financial information to go along with this, but they also said all Blizzard &#8220;All Blizzard franchises will become MMOGs.&#8221;. Who doubted me? Obviously not IGN, or any of the other major media sites who announced the upcoming release of Diablo 3 based off of my information and findings.</p>

<p>So why Blizzcon &#8216;06, why not E3 next year? Well, the original idea was that Burning Crusade would be out before Blizzcon &#8216;06, so it wouldn&#8217;t make much sense to have another session covering the game, and what else are they going to cover? Sure, they could have Starcraft Ghost Release Candidate 18 for the PS3 or some other bullshit, but let&#8217;s get serious. So let&#8217;s look at some facts:</p>

<p>* Blizzard North closed in 2005, which was the primary location for the Diablo franchise development. The company was merged with as we know now Blizzard Entertainment.<br>* Supposedly&#8211;â€œI am musician in Czech Republic. I play not with one orchestra but with many depending on work. I have recently been to Bratislava in Slovak Republic for recording sessions with local Radio Symphony Orchestra, where we just recorded music for Diablo 3.&#8221; Is this legit? You decide.<br>* Heaven vs Hell. Hell invading Heaven. Normal people don&#8217;t come up with this, and if they did, they would work for a company&#8211;perhaps Blizzard Entertainment? Not only is this a very realistic environment for the Diablo franchise, but the information came from a former Blizzard employee, who was in fact working with the Diablo teams at one point.<br>* And of course, the latest information, from Blizzard saying that all franchises will become MMOGs. Granted, this doesn&#8217;t mean it would happen soon, but with all the evidence supporting Diablo 3, and DMCA&#8217;s I consistently receive for releasing crap, I can see this happening.</p>

<p>There is one thing I did want to address as well. As far as I recall, Blizzard said, upon attending Blizzcon, you would receive a Beta code. If I remember correctly, they also stated the Beta code would not be for the World of Warcraft expansion, but a yet unannounced game release. Two days ago, a Blizzard representative said otherwise, &#8220;..that card is your entrance to play World Of Warcraft expansion before most any one else. I would recommend following the instructions and registering.&#8221; I call bullshit, riot anyone?</p>

<p>Now there is one final determining factor. Will there be a Blizzcon &#8216;06? This of course would play a huge rule on if it&#8217;s announced at the event. If there isn&#8217;t, which is up for debate (and I&#8217;m working on getting confirmation right now), then we may not see it until their next event, as there are no other huge announcements upcoming that I&#8217;m aware of. In my opinion they will save this for their own event, as it makes them a lot more do re me than announcing at E3 would.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>So I took a little time and moved my wiki off of World of Warcraft Guru since I won&#8217;t be working on the site anymore. I did this for no reason other than the EULA, as Blizzard doesn&#8217;t support it so it makes WG look bad. Doing this I bought a new domain, and buying a new domain lead me to buying more so I give you&#8230; <a href="http://www.hackwow.com/">HackWOW</a>, <a href="http://www.hackvanguard.com/">HackVanguard</a>, and my personal favorite, <a href="http://www.whatisige.com/">What is IGE</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also begun the &#8220;blacklist my sites&#8221; project, for Google. View the source of <a href="http://www.nibbits.com/">Nibbits</a> (scroll to the bottom), and view check the pages it links to. The &#8220;theory&#8221; is that Google counts a backlink as a unique domain (or subdomain), as I&#8217;ve noticed with MMO Files. So in theory 1234.mmofiles.com linking to nibbits.com, counts just as much as 3124.mmofiles.com linking to nibbits.com. Now all they are is an h1 (important!) and an a tag saying &#8220;Pie&#8221; linked a page named Pie, with an H1 labeled Pie, and the word Pie in EM and STRONG on the page, as well as linked to itself. Let&#8217;s see if I rank #1 in Google for Pie in 2 weeks :)</p>

<p>Last but not least, I posted some pictures of the Castle I visited recently on my &#8220;vacation&#8221;. Check them out in my <a href="/photos/">photo gallery</a>.</p>
